# forkify Project

The Forkify App allows users to search for recipes using API. Users can view the recipe along with the cook time and also increase or decrease the amount of servings they need. At this point the user can add favorite recipe to bookmarks or even add your own recipe. Favourite meals are stored in local storage so no database was required for this application.
